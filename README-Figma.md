**Quick action to select a random subset of your current selection.**

_Note: If you only have only one layer selected, and that layer has children, running this action will select from the children._

**Specify a Percentage of Total**
Pressing `Tab` rather than `Enter` lets you input a percentage which then selects that proportion of the currently selected items. For instance, if 100 circles are selected, and you choose 'Select Random Layers > 40%', it will randomly keep 40 circles from your original selection.
